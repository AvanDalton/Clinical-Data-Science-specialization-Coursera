## Assignment instructions

This assignment gave the students the opportunity to pull all the tools and techniques they had learned in this course and apply them to the real-world problem of identifying patients with hypertension.

In order to create this computational phenotyping algorithm and accomplish this task they have:

+ Tested two or more individual data types
+ Applied two or more manipulations of individual data types
+ Created two or more combinations of data types
+ Provided 2x2 tables and evaluation metrics (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV) for all algorithms tested.
+ Chosen and justified the selection of a final computational phenotyping algorithm

### Training Data

Gold standard data from manual record review was available on Google BigQuery in the "course3\_data.hypertension_goldstandard" table.

### Clinical background information

What is Hypertension?

- Systolic BP >= 140 mmHg on more than two occasions
- Diastolic BP>= 90 mmHg on more than two occasions

### How is hypertension billed?

Multiple codes for essential hypertension:

- 401.0 Malignant
- 401.1 Benign
- 401.9 Unspecified

Even more codes for other kinds of hypertension (e.g., hypertension in certain areas/vessels of the body)

### How is hypertension treated?

In addition to diet and exercise there are a number of blood pressure lowering drugs available. Many of these drugs have uses beyond treating hypertension and in fact may be used for non-hypertensive indications more frequently than hypertension. A quasi exhaustive list of these therapies as they are referred to by MIMIC records can be found on GBQ in course3\_data.D_ANTIHYPERTENSIVES.
