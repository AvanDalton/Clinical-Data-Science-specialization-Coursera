## Assignment instructions

The assignment took the students through the real world process Clinical Data Scientists use to translate data across different data models. The task was to translate one or more [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/) data table/s into the [OMOP](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki) CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table for at least the following three variables: person\_id, visit\_occurrence\_id, and condition\_source\_value. 

In order to accomplish this task, students had to:
- Understand the source and target data models in order to identify the correct MIMIC data table that maps to CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE.
- Identify and comment on profiling of the MIMIC source table
- Create the mappings between the MIMIC source table and OMOP condition_occurrence target table.
- Write and execute transformation code from the MIMIC source table to the OMOP CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE target table.
- Identify, perform, and explain a data quality assessment on the created OMOP CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE target.
