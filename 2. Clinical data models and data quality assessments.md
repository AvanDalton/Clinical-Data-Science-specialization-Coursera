The assignment took the students through the real world process Clinical Data Scientists use to translate data across different data models. The task was to translate one or more [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/) data table/s into the [OMOP](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki) CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table for at least the following three variables: person_id, visit_occurrence_id, and condition_source_value. 

In order to accomplish this task, students had to:
- Understand the source and target data models in order to identify the correct MIMIC data table that maps to CONDITION_OCCURRENCE.
- Identify and comment on profiling of the MIMIC source table
- Create the mappings between the MIMIC source table and OMOP condition_occurrence target table.
- Write and execute transformation code from the MIMIC source table to the OMOP CONDITION_OCCURRENCE target table.
- Identify, perform, and explain a data quality assessment on the created OMOP CONDITION_OCCURRENCE target.
